1. Prepare the training data set using pre-processing on the raw data. First we want to take
the dataset that contains the information that is called raw data. After we check for
missing values and outliers and noisy data in the given dataset, we remove all of them.
2. Identify useful attributes for classification In this all four attributes are useful for the
classification.
3. Later we reduce our dataset to have only past 20 yearsâ€™ data and train our neural network
using BPN and random incremental training model.
4. Later, we test our trained ANN.
