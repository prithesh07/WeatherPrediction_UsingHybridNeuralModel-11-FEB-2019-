After going through all the above study & discussion we see that applying NN with BPN algorithm for forecasting the climate detection. The dataset selection, input variable selection, the elationships & inter-conditions is most feasible rather than any other algorithm for climate detection approach. The study also says that NN with BPN algorithms are the best combination for climate dependencies among the data, the proper training set and the proper ANN architecture are most vital for the best prediction results. Finally the trained neural network can predict the future temperature with less error.
